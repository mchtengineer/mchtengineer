Hi, I am Mücahit Gündoğdu, studying at Ankara Yildirim Beyazıt University as a 4rd class Mechanical Engineering student.
Although I studied mechanical engineering, I am interested in software because of my love for technology.
Topics I'm currently trying to learn:
        
        - Data Entry, Data Visualization, Data Analysis with Python
        - Machine / Deep Learning
        - Artificial Intelligence
        - Robotics
As a career goal, I plan to be a successful engineer and not only be an engineer, but also to have knowledge in many fields outside of my own field, and to transfer the knowledge I learned in the best way to future generations and to apply it in my own life and to see myself in good places as a status. As a person who is open to learning and development, I believe that I can overcome any task with the determination of my desire to reach my goals.

My hobbies are reading articles or books on specific topics, aeronautics and space sciences, laying the foundation of software system analysis and control.

Thanks to my success-hungry personality, my passion for learning and development, my high motivation and ambition, I want to specialize in certain areas and improve myself as much as possible and spend my life without any regrets.
